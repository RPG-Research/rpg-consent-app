# Game Consent App
Role-Playing Game Consent App by Hawke Robinson et al.

Official website: <a href="https://www.gameconsent.com">www.gameconsent.com</a>

A web-based and mobile app for role-playing game masters to receive real-time anonymous feedback on the comfort level of their players.

The players join a "room" created by the GM, and based on the GM's settings for feedback, can provide real-time feedback about their comfort with the content or any other issues during the game, the GM can setup the parameters of feedback.

Default mode is to use the green-yellow-red indicator.

Other options available to the GM to setup for participant feedback can include various Likert scales, Faces scale, 1-10 scale, etc.
The GM can also have the option to create custom feedback forms for feedback on specific topics.

The GM does not know which players submit the information.

This can be used for tabletop role-playing (TRPG), live-action role-playing (LRPG, which also includes larps), electronic role-playing (ERPG), and various hybrids (HRPG).

This can be used for in-person gaming, as well as with remote gamers.

Users can use the password protected webpage option for a specific room, or they can use the mobile app version.

The GM has the Facilitator mode, and can receive real time notices on the GM's page/app during the game sessions.

There is also the option for after-game feedback.
