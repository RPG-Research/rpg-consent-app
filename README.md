Role-Playing Game Consent App by Hawke Robinson et al.

Official website: <a href="https://www.gameconsent.com">www.gameconsent.com</a>

A web-based and mobile app for role-playing game masters to receive real-time anonymous feedback on the comfort level of their players.


**Free Version
The public free version has just the most basic features:
1. Supported as web server application (Java or Python?), and iOS/Android mobile app (what tool to develop?). Users can use the password protected webpage option for a specific room, or they can use the mobile app version.
2. There are two groups: GM and Player.
3. GM controls who has access to "room"
4. Players able to join specific room provided by GM by invitation only
5. Players can tap Green, Yellow, or Red to indicate to GM real time issues. Green, Yellow, Red real-time indicator to the GM, yellow overrides Green, and red overrides yellow. The GM has the Facilitator mode, and can receive real time notices on the GM's page/app during the game sessions.
6. Fully anonymous, GM cannot tell which players chose something other than "Green".
7. GM can reset status for whole room at any time, which sends request to reset status indicator on GM's dashboard and on all player dashboards. Players prompted to accept reset or to maintain current status. If maintain current status, GM is notified that still at same level.

The players join a "room" created by the GM, and based on the GM's settings, can provide real-time feedback about their comfort with the content or any other issues during the activity.

Default free version only provides real-time green-yellow-red "Traffic light" option in anonymous only mode. Paid version has many more features.



**Paid Version Added Features (Proposed)

Additional features in the paid version (through RPG.LLC which will have to pay costs to get these developed and available on stores. 20% or more of profits donated to non-profit RPG Research).

Other options available to the GM to setup for participant feedback can include various Likert scales, Faces scale, 1-10 scale, etc.
The GM can also have the option to create custom feedback forms for feedback on specific topics.

Player can choose to levels of privacy: a) the default "confidential" (only GM sees the player's current status), or "anonymous" GM cannot see individual player's status, only GM's overall console of status for all players. If even one player wishes to be in anonymous mode, then GM cannot see status of any other players (otherwise process of elimination would be too likely).

Pre-game consent form features.

This can be used for tabletop role-playing (TRPG), live-action role-playing (LRPG, which also includes larps), electronic role-playing (ERPG), and various hybrids (HRPG).

This can be used for in-person gaming, as well as with remote gamers.

More variable group options to allow for assistant GM's without full GM access, and other groups configurable by master GM.
